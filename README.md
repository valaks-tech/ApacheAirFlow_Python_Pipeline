# ApacheAirFlow_Python_Pipeline
Creating data pipeline using Python, Apache AirFlow

To Do: Need to create data pipeline from source database (mySQL) to target database (PostgresSQL) 

Quick Note: SQLAlchemy may not needed here as its just for pipelines and we dont have to write complex SQL queries in this test case.
