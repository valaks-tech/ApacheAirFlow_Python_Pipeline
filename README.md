# ApacheAirFlow_Python_Pipeline
Creating data pipeline using Python, Apache AirFlow

To Do: Need to create data pipeline from source database (mySQL) to target database (PostgresSQL) 

Quick Note: SQLAlchemy may not be needed here as its just for pipelines and we dont have to write complex SQL queries in this test case. SQLAlchemy (an ORM) will only steamline the way you connect to the database and may not add any benefit in the case of pipelines. So not choosing SQLAlchemy here.
